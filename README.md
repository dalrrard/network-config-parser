## About

I needed a way to parse through large amounts of network device configuration files to make informed decisions about my network without relying on vendored solutions that weren't designed for my use case.

My goal is to build a tool that will parse relevant information in configuration files and act on that information.

### **This tool is in a pre-alpha stage**
